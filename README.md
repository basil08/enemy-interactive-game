# Enemy Interactive Game (enemy-interactive-game)   

An interactive non-linear story-telling of _"The Enemy"_ by _Pearl S. Buck_

## Motivation    

This project grew out of our (me and my group) English project assignment.
We had to do something creative, and integrating a web application with a different way of retelling the story seemed to me a sufficiently creative project. Also, I wanted to brush up on my basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.    
Needless to say, I was the only one interested in the project. 

## Design choices   

- Creating each scene by hand (on Pixton). There are around 60 scenes. Can be found in `/images`. I had to do all. Jeopardized studies :cold_sweat:   

- Implemented the game engine. It's basic DOM manipulation code to change scenes as per user choice (through button event handling).   

- Seperated the data ( scene description and images ) `scenes.js` from the program logic `engine.js`.

## Contributing    

All are welcome to contribute (though there is little reason to :sweat_smile:).  

[Here](https://ncert.nic.in/ncerts/l/levt104.pdf) is the original story.   
Also, don't hesitate to explore all branches in the game yourself. It's a great time-waster!   

1. More branches to the main "branch" would be awesome. More interesting, adventurous branches are particularly welcome.    
Just send me a PR.
